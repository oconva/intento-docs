### Testing Endpoints

You can test the IRS endpoints either using a graphical interface or by running the server locally and testing the endpoints using the terminal.

#### Test from Terminal

You can run the server locally to test the endpoints from their REST endpoints.

Before you can do this, you will need to first compile the TypeScript code.

Compile the TypeScript code. You can modify `.swcrc` to change the SWC configurations and `package.json` to adjust the build command.

```bash copy
npm run build
```

Or

```bash copy
pnpm build
```

Then, start the server:

```bash copy
npm run start
```

Or

```bash copy
pnpm start
```

Depending on which endpoint you wish to test, and where and on which port your server starts, you should be able to access the IRS endpoints through the terminal using the `curl` command. The below given example sends the query to the `irs` endpoint:

```bash copy
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3400/irs" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: a5zwhp0YlcRVkpnOXchIkL1lrmf0MPg24POM0kO6HcM=" -d '{"data": { "query": "add 4 litres milk?", "uid": "DI2UZuaTWjQPzVCRjzPW" } }'
```

#### Test Using Genkit Developer UI

You can run the Genkit developer UI to test the endpoints. Testing the endpoints using a graphical interface is probably the easiest way to get started. You can know more about the Genkit Developer UI [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/devtools#genkit_developer_ui).

Start the Genkit developer UI:

```bash copy
npx genkit start
```

OR, you can install the Genkit CLI globally:

```bash copy
npm i -g genkit
```

Then start the Genkit developer UI:

```bash copy
genkit start
```

You should be able to see your defined IRS endpoints under the **Flows** section in the left sidebar. Simply click on the endpoint you want to test and enter the query you want to test with. Clicking the **Run** button will send the query to the endpoint and the response generation process will start.
