  An open source framework to help you build performant, reliable, and secure
  **intent recognition services** powered by LLMs.

**QvikChat** was born out of the need for a simple, yet powerful, conversational AI framework that can enable developers to quickly build AI-powered chat apps or services, with all the necessary features and safety guardrails in place.

Check the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide to learn how to get started with QvikChat.
